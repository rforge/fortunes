Thomas W. Blackwell: I just discovered to my surprise that I cannot define a function with an argument named 'break' or 'while'!<x>Brian D. Ripley: No, they are reserved names.

Before we get too carried away with this thread could you all please consider how the sd function calculates its result? [...] I'll tell you, it takes the square root of the variance.  How is the variance calculated for a numeric vector? First you calculate the mean *using floating point arithmetic* in which it is not necessarily true that N * k / N == k [...] Most of those tests [for numerical accuracy] end in a check using the all.equal function which checks if the relative difference is less than a threshold. That's about the best that you can do with floating point arithmetic.<x>Here endeth the sermon.;Douglas Bates;after a discussion why sd(rep(0.001, 15)) is not necessarily exactly 0;R-help;March 2004

I'd like to prefix all these solutions with `Here's how to do it, but don't actually do it you crazy fool'. It's on a par with redefining pi, or redefining '+'. And then redefining '<-'. These techniques have their proper place, and that would be in the currently non-existent obfuscated R contest.<x>No, the R-ish (iRish?) way is to index vectors from 1. That's what the R gods intended!;Barry Rowlingson;in a discussion how vectors in R could be indexed starting from 0;R-help;March 2004

"I'm really curious to know why the ""two types"" of sum of squares are called ""Type I"" and ""Type III""! This is a very common misconception, particularly among SAS users who have been fed this nonsense quite often for all their professional lives. Fortunately the reality is much simpler. There is, by any sensible reckoning, only ONE type of sum of squares, and it always represents an improvement sum of squares of the outer (or alternative) model over the inner (or null hypothesis) model. What the SAS highly dubious classification of sums of squares does is to encourage users to concentrate on the null hypothesis model and to forget about the alternative. This is always a very bad idea and not surprisingly it can lead to nonsensical tests, as in the test it provides for main effects ""even in the presence of interactions"", something which beggars definition, let alone belief.";Bill Venables;NA;R-help;November 2000

Pavel Khomski: How can I specify the random part in the GLMM-call (of the lme4 library) for compound matrices just in the the same way as they defined in the lme-Call (of the nlme library).<x>Martin Maechler: ``twice in such a short paragraph -- yikes !!'' ...

A sufficiently trained statistician can read the vagaries of a Q-Q plot like a shaman can read a chicken's entrails, with a similar recourse to scientific principles. Interpreting Q-Q plots is more a visceral than an intellectual exercise. The uninitiated are often mystified by the process. Experience is the key here.;Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Murdoch University;NA;StatsNotes;NA

Just now I had an apparently insurmountable problem that's been bugging me for days, but phrasing my question in a form suitable for the R-help list enabled me to solve my own problem in two minutes flat.<x>Thanks everyone.;Robin Hankin;NA;R-help;March 2005
Actually, I see it as part of my job to inflict R on people who are perfectly happy to have never heard of it. Happiness doesn't equal proficient and efficient. In some cases the proficiency of a person serves a greater good than their momentary happiness.;Patrick Burns;NA;R-help;April 2005
Evelyn Hall: I would like to know how (if) I can extract some of the information from the summary of my nlme.<x>Simon Blomberg: This is R. There is no if. Only how.;Evelyn Hall and Simon `Yoda' Blomberg;NA;R-help;April 2005
Tradition among experienced S programmers has always been that loops (typically `for' loops) are intrinsically inefficient: expressing computations without loops has provided a measure of entry into the inner circle of S programming.;John Chambers;NA;Programming With Data, p. 173;1998

"We are teaching stuff like mathematics, statistics, statistical programming and so on, but we cannot teach each possible software product - we also don't teach how to analyze each possible dataset that might find its way to the statistician's desk, we just use the iris data and Anscombe's quartet. ;-)";Uwe Ligges;in a thread about whether universities have to teach students how to use commercial software;R-help;April 2005
Usually (but not always) doing tests of normality reflect a lack of understanding of the power of rank tests, and an assumption of high power for the tests (qq plots don't always help with that because of their subjectivity). When possible it's good to choose a robust method. Also, doing pre-testing for normality can affect the type I error of the overall analysis.;Frank Harrell;NA;R-help;April 2005
As for elegance, R is refined, tasteful, and beautiful. When I grow up, I want to marry R.;Andy Bunn;in a discussion about whether R is simple, powerful and elegant;R-help;May 2005
Frank Harrell: Here is an easy approach that will yield results only slightly less valid than one actually using the response variable:<x>  x <- data.frame(x1, x2, x3, x4, ..., other potential predictors)<x>  x[ , sample(ncol(x))]<x>Andy Liaw: Hmm...

Sean Davis: It got me going quickly with S4 methods, which it seems to me are the way to go in most cases.<x>Rolf Turner: If you want to simultaneously handcuff yourself, strap yourself into a strait jacket, and tie yourself in knots, and moreover write code which is incomprehensible to the human mind, then S4 methods are indeed the way to go.;Sean Davis and Rolf Turner;expressing different views about the benefits of S4 classes;R-help;May 2005
I wish to perform brain surgery this afternoon at 4pm and don't know where to start. My background is the history of great statistician sports legends but I am willing to learn. I know there are courses and numerous books on brain surgery but I don't have the time for those. Please direct me to the appropriate HowTos, and be on standby for solving any problem I may encounter while in the operating room. Some of you might ask for specifics of the case, but that would require my following the posting guide and spending even more time than I am already taking to write this note.;I.

"As a general rule (subject to numerous exceptions, caveats, etc.):<x>1) it is programming and debugging time that most impacts `overall' program execution time;<x>2) this is most strongly impacted by code readability and size (the smaller the better);<x>3) both of which are enhanced by modular construction and reuseability, which argues for avoiding inline code and using separate functions.<x>These days, I would argue that most of the time it is program clarity and correctness (they are related) that is the important issue, not execution speed.";Berton Gunter;in a discussion about parsing speed;R-help;May 2005

"As a general rule (subject to numerous exceptions, caveats, etc.):<x>1) it is programming and debugging time that most impacts `overall' program execution time;<x>2) this is most strongly impacted by code readability and size (the smaller the better);<x>3) both of which are enhanced by modular construction and reuseability, which argues for avoiding inline code and using separate functions.<x>These days, I would argue that most of the time it is program clarity and correctness (they are related) that is the important issue, not execution speed.";Berton Gunter;in a discussion about parsing speed;R-help;May 2005

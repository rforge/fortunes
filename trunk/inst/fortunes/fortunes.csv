Before we get too carried away with this thread could you all please consider how the sd function calculates its result? [...] I'll tell you, it takes the square root of the variance.  How is the variance calculated for a numeric vector? First you calculate the mean *using floating point arithmetic* in which it is not necessarily true that N * k / N == k [...] Most of those tests [for numerical accuracy] end in a check using the all.equal function which checks if the relative difference is less than a threshold. That's about the best that you can do with floating point arithmetic.<x>Here endeth the sermon.;Douglas Bates;after a discussion why sd(rep(0.001, 15)) is not necessarily exactly 0;R-help;March 2004

My preference goes with the numbering scheme attributed to a tribe on some island in the Pacific which consists of a 'factor' with four levels: 'one', 'two', 'three', and 'lots'.

It seems to me against the spirit of Open Source software to attempt to monitor distribution.

Some of us feel that type III sum of squares and so-called ls-means are statistical nonsense which should have been left in SAS.;Brian D. Ripley;NA;s-news;May 1999
"I'm really curious to know why the ""two types"" of sum of squares are called ""Type I"" and ""Type III""! This is a very common misconception, particularly among SAS users who have been fed this nonsense quite often for all their professional lives. Fortunately the reality is much simpler. There is, by any sensible reckoning, only ONE type of sum of squares, and it always represents an improvement sum of squares of the outer (or alternative) model over the inner (or null hypothesis) model. What the SAS highly dubious classification of sums of squares does is to encourage users to concentrate on the null hypothesis model and to forget about the alternative. This is always a very bad idea and not surprisingly it can lead to nonsensical tests, as in the test it provides for main effects ""even in the presence of interactions"", something which beggars definition, let alone belief.";Bill Venables;NA;R-help;November 2000
"I was profoundly disappointed when I saw that S-PLUS 4.5 now provides ""Type III"" sums of squares as a routine option for the summary method for aov objects. I note that it is not yet available for multistratum models, although this has all the hallmarks of an oversight (that is, a bug) rather than common sense seeing the light of day. When the decision was being taken of whether to include this feature, ""because the FDA requires it"" a few of my colleagues and I were consulted and our reply was unhesitatingly a clear and unequivocal ""No"", but it seems the FDA and SAS speak louder and we were clearly outvoted.";Bill Venables;NA;`Exegeses on Linear Models' paper;May 2000
